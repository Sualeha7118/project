              As you would expect, the Acropolis has the final word of what to
              see in Athens. The temples on the sacred rock are considered the
              most important monuments in Western civilisation and have
              influenced architecture more than anything else since. From the
              top, its mesmerising view has been a source of inspiration for
              many foreign travellers, poets and writers during the 18th
              century.

              Shark cage diving is designed to be a viewing experience. You get
              in the cage to go and see sharks underwater. Thick prison bars get
              in the way, so cages are designed with openings. The idea is that
              the hole - while often large - is not big enough for a shark to
              actually get in.
